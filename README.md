This file showcases some fun Java programs I've developed to help me get better at java.


The difference between two  

Is a Java program that prompts the user to enter radius and height for two different sized cones. It outputs the difference on their size. 
The formula for the volume of a cone is V = Ï€ * r2 * h/3.  
it declares PI  as a constant variable and initializes it as a double data type with a value of 3.14159.

The next program is the start of a game based on teaching children arithmetic. 

The 3rd program shows you how to calculate the day of the week with and int data type, how to calculate the square root of a number, exponents,

and provides some established code that you can build with.
